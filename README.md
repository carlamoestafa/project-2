# PROJECT-2 PLAN
___
## BACKGROUND
With increased interest in veganism (articles, vdo streaming, social media, dedicated sections for vegan products in the supermarkets etc...), I would like to first confirm if my perception is correct and unbiased. Furthermore, I would like to see if there are any correlations with other factors such as income, health, education level and environment.
## METHOD
Data required will be acquired by web scraping. 
Although data recording the number or proportion of vegans in the various populations is very limited, [GoogleTrends data for vegan](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=RU&q=vegan) is available. These data will be used and analysed based on the assumption that increasing search trends means increasing interest and vice versa. For the correlation analysis, feature data will be chosen from indices recorded and maintained by [OECD Organisation](https://www.oecd.org).</br>
Selected indices from OECD comprise of the following:
- GDP or average wages or cost of living if available
- Meat consumption
- Crop production
- Education performance or Adult education level?
- Alcolhol consumption
- Health: Life expentacy, Suicides rates, (cancer, diabetes, heart disease)
- CO2 emissions

The GoogleTrends data for the vegan term will be collected and analysed and then collated with the selected OECD Countries feature data.
